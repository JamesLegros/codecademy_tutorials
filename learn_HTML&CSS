HTML & CSS Tutorial

HMTL  = HyperText Markup Language
CSS   = Cascading Style Sheets

Set up the skeleton of the page:
a. Always put <!DOCTYPE html> on the first line. This tells the browser what language its reading
b. Always put <html> on the next line. This starts the HTML document
c. Always put </html> on the last line. This ends the HTML document

Basic Terminology
1. Things inside '<>'s are called tags
2. Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
3. Opening tag: <html>
4. Closing tag: </html>

Treat tags like parentheses. Tags can also nest, so pay attention

An HTML file has both a head and a body. 
Head: where you put information about the HTML file, like its title
Body: where you put your content, such as text, images, and links. The content in the body is what will be visible on the actual page

Body tags:
<p>, </p> : Pargraph tag
<h1>, </h1> : Title tag
6 sizes of Title tags, 1 is largest, 6 is smallest

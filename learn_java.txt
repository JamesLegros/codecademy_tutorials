Intro to Java

  Data Types:
  int     - Whole number
  boolean - True/False
  char    - Single character
  
  Variables     - Used to store values
  Whitespace    - Makes code readable, java ignores it
  Comments (//) - Describe code and its purpose
  
  Arithmetic Operators:
  +, -, *, /, %
  
  Relational Operators:
  <, <=, >, >=
  
  Equality Operators:
  ==, !=

Conditionals and Control Flow

Order of Boolean Operations:
1. ! (NOT)
2. && (AND)
3. || (OR)

Statements:
if, if/else, if/else if/ else statements are used to conditionally execute blocks of code

Ternary Conditional:
A shortened verision of an if/else statement that returns a value based on the value of a Boolean expression

Switch:
Allows us to check the equality of a varaible expression with a value that does not need a Boolean

Object Oriented Java (OOP)

Class:
A blueprint for how a data structure should function

Constructor:
Instructs the class to set up the intial state of an object

Object:
Instance of a class that stores the state of a class

Method: 
Set of instructions that can be called on an object

Parameter:
Values that can be specified when creating an object or calling a method

Return value:
Specifies the data type that a method will return after it runs

Inheritance:
Allows one class to use functionality defined in another class
